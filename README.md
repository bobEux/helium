HeliumChain is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget proposals. The goal of HeliumChain is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, called _SwiftX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.

##### Note: In August 2020, Helium (HLM) was rebranded as sQuorum (SQR).  There was no coin swap.  The Helium wallet will not process blocks after 999,999 and the official sQuorum wallet uses the same wallet.dat file and private keys so your Helium balance is now your sQuorum balance.  Please download the official wallet at https://github.com/heliumchain/squorum/releases/
